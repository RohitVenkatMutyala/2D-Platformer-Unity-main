### **Game Features and Design** 
1. **Narrative Introduction:** 
- The game begins with a strong narrative, immersing the player into the protagonist’s life in a snowy remote village. 
- The protagonist is a poor man in his 30s, struggling to keep his sick wife alive amidst harsh winter conditions. The narration sets an emotional tone and establishes urgency. 
2. **Character Abilities:** 
- The protagonist (referred to as "Fox" after teleportation) can: 
- **Move forward** and **backward.** 
- **Jump** to navigate the environment. 
- However, jumping on **ice blocks**, **void spaces**, or **enemies** will result in failure and force the player to restart the level with collected items reset to zero. 
3. **Game Mechanisms:** 
- **Master's Guidance:** The protagonist meets an old master meditating by a fire. The master acts as a guide and teleports the player to different levels to achieve specific goals. 
- **Objectives per Level:** Each level has a distinct goal: 
- **Collect logs** for warmth. 
- **Find medicine** to treat the wife’s fever. 
- **Gather food** for survival. 
- **Treasure Hunt:** In each level, finding the treasure is mandatory to return to the starting point. 
4. **Progression System:** 
- The player is teleported to new challenges by the master after completing each goal, maintaining a sense of continuity in the storyline. 
- Each level has the same core mechanics but with a different layout, creating variety while preserving familiarity.   
### **Levels and Traps** 
1. **Level 1: Collecting Logs** 
- **Objective:** The player must collect logs scattered across the level while avoiding traps and enemies. 
- **Traps:** 
- **Enemy Cats with Weapons:** Cats patrol certain areas and can cause the player to restart if touched. 
- **Ice Blocks:** The player cannot jump on ice blocks. Doing so results in falling into a void space, forcing a restart. 
- **Void Spaces:** Gaps in the terrain act as hazards, requiring careful navigation to avoid falling. 
- **Treasure:** Hidden within the level, the treasure must be found to return to the starting point. 
2. **Level 2: Collecting Medicine** 
- **Objective:** The player collects scattered medicine to cure the wife’s fever. 
- **Game Environment:** A new layout with slightly increased difficulty compared to Level 1. 
- **Traps:** 
- Same as Level 1, but with more frequent ice blocks and void spaces, demanding better precision and planning. 
- **Treasure:** Hidden and guarded, ensuring the player explores thoroughly before escaping. 
3. **Level 3: Collecting Food** 
- **Objective:** The player gathers food for both himself and his wife. 
- **Game Environment:** The most challenging layout, with more complex terrain and traps. 
- **Traps:** 
- Increased number of patrolling enemy cats. 
- Narrow platforms require precise jumps to avoid ice blocks and voids. 
- Hidden pathways to find the treasure, encouraging exploration. 
### **Key Features** 
1. **Emotional Engagement:** 
- The game immerses players in the protagonist’s struggle for survival, evoking empathy as he battles poverty, cold, and time to save his wife and himself. The narrative creates a strong emotional connection with the player. 
2. **Challenging Gameplay:** 
- Players navigate through traps like ice blocks, void spaces, and patrolling enemies, requiring careful planning and precise movements. Progress resets upon failure, adding tension and stakes to the gameplay. 
3. **Incorporation of SDGs:** 
- The game reflects themes aligned with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): 
- **SDG 1: No Poverty:** Highlights the hardships faced by those in poverty, such as the lack of basic necessities like firewood, medicine, and food. 
- **SDG 2: Zero Hunger:** The final level emphasizes the critical importance of food security, as the protagonist must collect food to ensure his and his wife’s survival. 
- **SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being:** Stresses the urgency of accessing medicine to treat illness and improve quality of life in challenging conditions. 
- **SDG 13: Climate Action:** Portrays the harsh impacts of extreme winters, indirectly raising awareness about environmental issues and the need for resourcefulness in adverse weather. 
4. **Replayability:** 
- Increasing difficulty and varying layouts across levels encourage players to refine strategies, adding to the game’s replay value. 
5. **Consistency in Mechanics:** 
- Uniform controls and mechanics across all levels ensure a smooth player experience, with the focus remaining on mastering challenges rather than learning new controls. 
6. **Exploration and Discovery:** 
- Hidden treasures in every level reward curiosity and strategic exploration, adding depth and complexity to the gameplay.
